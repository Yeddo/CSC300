/*
 - class for introducing graphs & graph algorithms
 - for simplification, we have the following restrictions:
    - less than 100 nodes
    - no self edges
    - all graph description files will be weighted
    - all weights > 0

 - node order
    print out the nodes, on 1 line, in the order dictated by algorithm
 - spanning tree
    print out edges     start-end   in the order dictated by algorithm



Graph Description File format
  Number of Nodes
  Number of Edges
  Source  Destination  Weight     [ for each edge ]
